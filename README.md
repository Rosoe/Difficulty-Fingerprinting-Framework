# Game Difficulty Framework

## Understanding Human Responses to Gaming Challenges

This framework provides a structured approach to analysing game difficulty by focusing on the fundamental human capabilities and responses that games test, rather than specific mechanics or genres. By focusing on player responses rather than game features, we can create a robust model that adapts to any type of game challenge.

## Core Principles

### Player-Centric Analysis
Instead of categorising what games present to players, this framework examines how players are challenged. This approach allows us to:
- Analyse any game, regardless of genre or style
- Identify common patterns across seemingly different games
- Understand how various challenges stress different player capabilities

### Fundamental Categories
The framework is built around eight core categories of player response:
- Performance (neurological/physical capabilities)
- Execution (real-time decision making)
- Comprehension (understanding systems)
- Strategy (long-term planning)
- Learning/Research (systematic investigation)
- Meta-Adaptation (predicting system changes)
- Emotional Management (handling pressure/setbacks)
- Social (managing multiplayer dynamics)

Each category represents a distinct type of human capability that games can challenge.

## Using the Framework

### Analysing Games
When analysing a game's difficulty:
1. Focus on what players must do, not what the game presents
2. Break down challenges into their fundamental components
3. Identify which core capabilities are being tested
4. Consider how different capabilities interact

### Understanding Combinations
Most gaming challenges are combinations of fundamental capabilities. For example:
- Puzzle-solving combines Comprehension, Execution, and Emotional Management
- Exploration combines Performance, Strategy, and Comprehension
- Creative building combines Comprehension, Strategy, and Execution

## Limitations and Scope

This framework specifically addresses:
- Difficulty analysis
- Player capability requirements
- Challenge decomposition

It does not cover:
- Game genres
- Game mechanics
- Aesthetic qualities
- Content themes
- Design patterns
- Player motivation
- Player enjoyment

## Common Patterns

While the framework focuses on fundamental capabilities, common gameplay patterns emerge from combinations of these capabilities. For example:

Exploration in games is not a distinct category but a combination of:
- Performance (spatial navigation)
- Comprehension (understanding environment rules)
- Strategy (planning routes and approaches)
- Emotional Management (handling uncertainty)

These combinations create recognisable gameplay patterns while remaining analysable through the framework's fundamental categories.

## Best Practices

When using the framework:
- Always start with player responses, not game features
- Consider both immediate and long-term challenges
- Look for how fundamental capabilities combine
- Remember that similar game features might test different capabilities
- Consider context when analysing difficulty

## Framework Evolution

This framework is designed to be:
- Extensible within its categories
- Adaptable to new types of games
- Focused on fundamental human capabilities
- Clear about its scope and limitations

## Conclusion

By focusing on human responses rather than game features, this framework provides a robust tool for analysing game difficulty across any type of game. Understanding these fundamental categories and how they combine allows for deep analysis while maintaining clarity and usability.

# The Framework

## 1. Performance
Performance encompasses skills where immediate physical or neurological capability is the primary constraint on success. These are typically fast, unconscious, and direct actions with clear feedback loops and high certainty of outcomes.

### Physical Performance Elements

- Motor Control (Maintaining consistent aim while tracking targets in CS:GO)
- Reaction Processing (Blocking mix-ups in Street Fighter on reaction)

## 2. Execution
Execution involves active mental processing and tactical decision-making in real-time situations. It represents the bridge between understanding and performance, focusing on adaptation and strategic application under pressure. Execution deals with mixed levels of certainty - outcomes are influenced by changing conditions but feedback loops remain relatively short.

### Key Elements
- Real-time decision making
- Tactical adaptation and flexibility
- Pattern recognition and response
- Priority management
- Threat assessment
- Resource allocation under time pressure
- Choosing which variations to calculate or analyse
- Managing limited time and attention

### Examples
- Adapting strategies mid-fight in combat games
- Changing tactics based on opponent patterns
- Managing cooldowns in MMO encounters
- Maintaining high APM in strategy games
- Adjusting playstyle based on matchup dynamics
- Making tactical decisions under time pressure
- Calculating chess variations in blitz games

## 3. Comprehension
Comprehension involves understanding game systems, patterns, and principles. It encompasses both basic mechanical understanding and complex strategic patterns that have become internalised knowledge. While comprehension can include sophisticated concepts, its core feature is that it's about understanding what is happening rather than making decisions about how to use that understanding.

### Key Elements
- Understanding system mechanics and interactions
- Grasping strategic principles and patterns
- Recognising position types and their implications
- Knowledge of optimal approaches
- Understanding matchup dynamics
- Pattern recognition
- Integration of strategic concepts into intuitive understanding
- 2D/3D spatial memory

### Examples
- Understanding frame data in fighting games
- Grasping boss mechanics and optimal strategies in MMOs
- Knowledge of build orders in strategy games
- Understanding positional chess principles
- Recognising optimal item builds in MOBAs
- Understanding theoretical counters and responses
- Understanding move properties
- Recognising weak pawn structures in chess
- Recognising when a position is advantageous

### Suggested Difficulty Wheel Categories
- System Mechanics Understanding: Knowing how poise works in Dark Souls
- Strategic Pattern Recognition: Understanding chess positions and their implications
- Position/State Evaluation: Recognising advantageous board states in Go
- Optimal Approach Analysis: Understanding which Pokemon counter others
- Matchup Understanding: Knowing character strengths/weaknesses in fighters
- System Interaction Knowledge: Understanding how different Magic cards combine

## 4. Strategy
Strategy operates at the highest level of abstraction, dealing with decisions about how to approach the game itself. It handles the longest feedback loops and highest levels of uncertainty. Strategy involves making decisions about which systems to engage with and how to allocate limited resources like time and attention.

### Key Elements
- Long-term planning and resource allocation
- Balancing long and short term goals
- Decisions about what skills to develop
- Choosing which systems to engage with
- Understanding hidden costs and benefits
- Managing uncertainty in long-term decisions
- Balancing immediate versus long-term gains
- Meta-level understanding of game contexts

### Examples
- Deciding whether to master one character or learn many
- Choosing between an economic focus versus pure leveling in MMOs
- Selecting which game systems to invest time in learning
- Planning tournament preparation approaches
- Deciding between practicing fundamentals versus specific techniques in fighting games
- Choosing what openings to learn in chess based on playing style
- Balancing time between different aspects of improvement

### Relationship with Other Categories
Strategy sits above Performance, Execution, and Comprehension in terms of abstraction level. While these other categories deal with understanding and using specific game systems, Strategy deals with decisions about which systems to engage with and how deeply. It operates with the highest level of uncertainty:

- Performance has immediate, clear feedback
- Execution has short feedback loops with some variables
- Comprehension has longer feedback loops with more variables
- Strategy has the longest feedback loops and most uncertainty

Strategic decisions often require resisting immediate tactical opportunities in favor of long-term benefits, creating tension between strategic planning and moment-to-moment execution.

### Suggested Difficulty Wheel Categories
- Long-term Planning [choosing which Pokémon to EV train for team composition]
- Resource Allocation [deciding which buildings to construct in Factorio supply chain]
- System Engagement Choices [selecting which mechanics to master in Monster Hunter]
- Risk/Reward Evaluation [deciding whether to push towers or farm in MOBAs]
- Meta-level Understanding [choosing which characters to invest time in for tournaments]
- Time Investment Planning [balancing raid prep vs daily quests in MMOs]
- Risk Management [diversifying practiced strategies before tournaments]

## 5. Learning and Research
Learning and Research involves systematic approaches to understanding game systems when natural intuition and experience-based learning prove insufficient. It operates at a higher level of abstraction than Strategy, dealing with the creation and validation of new knowledge.

### Key Elements
- Systematic approaches to understanding complex systems
- Hypothesis generation and testing
- Data collection and analysis methodologies
- Knowledge validation and verification
- Tool development and implementation
- Meta-cognitive skills (questioning existing knowledge)
- Research planning and resource management
- Documentation and knowledge sharing

### Examples
- Developing parsing tools to measure true DPS contributions
- Systematic testing of obscure mechanics (like FF11 gardening)
- Creating frameworks to validate community theories
- Building and testing hypotheses about complex systems
- Developing methodologies for testing game mechanics
- Conducting long-term studies of variable systems
- Creating documentation and proving findings to others

### Relationship with Other Categories
Learning/Research activates when:
- Strategy identifies critical knowledge gaps
- Natural pattern recognition hits its limits
- Experience-based heuristics prove unreliable
- Systems are too complex for intuitive understanding
- Feedback loops are too long for natural learning

The knowledge gained through Learning/Research can eventually be simplified into heuristics and patterns that work within the Comprehension-Execution axis, but the original research process requires dedicated systematic approach beyond normal play.

### Suggested Difficulty Wheel Categories
- Systematic Testing [documenting exact frame data in fighting games]
- Data Collection Methods [tracking spawn patterns in speedruns]
- Theory Development [creating new Minecraft redstone mechanisms]
- Knowledge Validation [proving suspected mechanics in Dark Souls]

- Documentation Methods [maintaining wikis for complex game systems]
- Research Planning [organizing testing for optimal MMO raid strategies]

## 6. Meta-Adaptation
Meta-adaptation involves predicting and leveraging changes in game environments before they fully manifest. Unlike strategy which operates within known systems, meta-adaptation deals with anticipating how systems themselves will evolve through developer intervention, community discovery, and collective player behavior. It operates with the highest level of uncertainty and longest feedback loops in competitive gaming.

### Key Elements
- Anticipating shifts in competitive environments
- Predicting developer balance decisions and their cascading effects
- Understanding community psychology and behavior patterns
- Recognizing when current approaches will hit limitations
- Identifying emerging trends before they become dominant
- Managing high-risk, high-commitment decisions
- Leveraging historical patterns to predict future developments
- Reading multiple layers of human behavior (developers, pros, community)

### Examples
- Predicting which strategies will fill the vacuum after anticipated nerfs
- Investing in mastering emerging techniques before they become meta
- Cornering in-game markets based on predicted community behavior shifts
- Developing counters to strategies that aren't dominant yet
- Recognizing when to pivot personal skill development
- Anticipating how patches will affect entire role/class ecosystems
- Timing strategic shifts to align with community meta evolution

### Relationship with Other Categories
Meta-adaptation often requires synthesis across multiple skill categories:
- Uses Learning/Research to gather historical patterns
- Requires deep Comprehension of game systems
- Leverages Social skills to understand community dynamics
- Builds on Strategy but focuses on system evolution rather than optimization

Most relevant in:
- Live service games with regular updates
- Games with active esports communities
- Complex games with emergent strategies
- Games with player-driven economies

### Suggested Difficulty Wheel Categories
- Community Trend Analysis [predicting MOBA meta shifts after patches]
- Developer Pattern Recognition [anticipating balance changes based on past patterns]
- System Evolution Prediction [investing in items likely to become valuable]
- Long-term Investment Planning [choosing skills that will remain valuable post-patch]
- Meta Shift Preparation [practicing counters to emerging strategies]

## 7. Emotional Management
Emotional Management encompasses the skills and capabilities related to understanding, controlling, and effectively channeling emotions during gameplay. It involves both immediate emotional regulation and longer-term emotional resilience, affecting how players handle challenges, process outcomes, and maintain effective engagement with games. This includes managing both personal emotional responses and emotions triggered by social interactions.

### Key Elements
- Managing immediate emotional responses (frustration, anxiety, excitement)
- Maintaining emotional stability and composure
- Building and managing confidence and self-esteem
- Developing emotional resilience and stamina
- Recognizing and adapting to emotional states
- Channeling positive emotions productively
- Processing failure and setbacks constructively
- Sustaining motivation and patience

- Clear comprehension helps set realistic expectations, managing emotional investment

#### Meta-Adaptation
- Emotional stability is required to make objective meta-level decisions
- Strong emotional management enables clear assessment of when to pivot strategies
- Managing emotions helps in accepting when current approaches need to change

These interactions highlight how emotional management both supports and is supported by other skills, though the core emotional management capabilities remain distinct.

### Suggested Difficulty Wheel Categories
- Immediate Response Control [maintaining composure after a bad trade in card games]
- Performance Stability [staying focused during long tournament brackets]
- Confidence Management [recovering after losing early rounds]
- Emotional Resilience [continuing to practice after repeated failures]
- Motivation Maintenance [grinding through long practice sessions]
- Failure Processing [learning from losses without tilting]
- Social-emotional Response [handling trash talk in competitive environments]

## 8. Social Management
Social Difficulty encompasses skills related to navigating multiplayer social structures, managing relationships, and coordinating group efforts. It involves understanding social hierarchies, building and maintaining connections, and effectively collaborating with others to achieve shared goals. While social elements can interact with and potentially bypass other types of difficulty, core social difficulty focuses on fundamental interpersonal and organizational capabilities.

### Key Elements

- Managing team dynamics in high-pressure situations
- Coordinating between different player groups
- Maintaining productive team environments

### Relationship with Other Categories
Social Difficulty interacts extensively with other difficulty types for some games but maintains distinct fundamental skills. While social connections can sometimes bypass other difficulties (like getting help with research or receiving economic support), the core social skills remain challenging to develop and master.

- Performance requires individual execution, but social skills enable effective team coordination
- Execution often involves personal decision-making, while social focuses on group dynamics
- Comprehension deals with understanding systems, while social handles human relationships
- Strategy operates at a high level of abstraction, but social provides unique implementation challenges
- Learning/Research focuses on systematic understanding, while social handles human networks
- Meta-adaptation predicts system changes, while social manages human relationships
- Emotional Management handles personal responses, while social manages group dynamics

### Co-Interactions
Social Difficulty frequently combines with other categories to create complex challenges:
- With Performance: Coordinating group execution, managing team rotations
- With Execution: Communicating tactical decisions, coordinating real-time responses
- With Comprehension: Sharing and validating knowledge, teaching others
- With Strategy: Organizing long-term group efforts, managing social resources
- With Learning/Research: Building knowledge-sharing networks, coordinating group research
- With Meta-adaptation: Managing group responses to changes, coordinating strategic shifts
- With Emotional Management: Handling group morale, managing team psychology

The effectiveness of social skills often amplifies or enables other types of difficulty management, while core social challenges remain distinct and fundamental to multiplayer gaming environments.

### Suggested Difficulty Wheel Categories

- Review model against EVERY MARIO PARTY MINIGAME

### Combinatorial Analysis
If a game stresses multiple skills (Social and Research) then does this make it a new game?

### Spectrum Analysis
These categories exist along several key spectrums:

#### Speed Spectrum (Slow → Fast)
- Comprehension: Slowest - requires time for analysis
- Execution: Medium - real-time decisions with tactical thinking
- Performance: Fastest - immediate reactions

#### Consciousness Spectrum (Conscious → Unconscious)
- Comprehension: Most conscious - active analysis
- Execution: Mixed - blend of conscious and intuitive
- Performance: Most unconscious - trained reactions

#### Directness Spectrum (Indirect → Direct)
- Comprehension: Most indirect - theoretical understanding
- Execution: Mixed - applying knowledge tactically
- Performance: Most direct - immediate action/reaction

#### Certainty Spectrum (Certain > Uncertain)

##### Performance (Most Certain)
"If I press these buttons in this sequence, this combo will come out"
- Clear, immediate feedback
- Success/failure is instantly apparent
- Physical constraints are well understood

##### Execution (Mixed Certainty)
"If I see the boss wind up this attack, blocking is probably better than dodging"
- Short feedback loops
- Outcomes influenced by changing conditions
- Some variables but still relatively contained

##### Comprehension (Less Certain)
"I understand how this system works in principle"
- Longer feedback loops
- More variables to consider
- Theory might not match practice

##### Strategy (Most Uncertain)
"Investing 20 hours in learning the economy might pay off better than 20 hours of combat practice"
- Very long feedback loops
- Huge number of variables
- Success metrics might not be clear
- What worked for others might not work for you
- Meta changes could invalidate investments

### Potential Spectrums
Speed of action to results (feedback)
- Click and kill a guy (performance, fast cuz guy dies)
- Talk to an acquaintance in game (Social, slow because this is one positive unit for building friendship that can help with goals later)
