# Game Difficulty Framework

## Understanding Human Responses to Gaming Challenges
This framework provides a structured approach to analysing game difficulty by focusing on the fundamental human capabilities and responses that games test, rather than specific mechanics or genres. By focusing on player responses rather than game features, we can create a robust model that adapts to any type of game challenge.

## Core Principles

### Player-Centric Analysis
Instead of categorising what games present to players, this framework examines how players are challenged. This approach allows us to:
- Analyse any game, regardless of genre or style
- Identify common patterns across seemingly different games
- Understand how various challenges stress different player capabilities

### Fundamental Categories
The framework is built around eight core categories of player response:
- Performance (neurological/physical capabilities)
- Execution (decision making)
- Comprehension (understanding systems)
- Strategy (long-term planning)
- Learning/Research (systematic investigation)
- Meta and External Knowledge (Non-game knowledge and prediction)
- Emotional Management (handling pressure/setbacks)
- Social (managing social dynamics)

Each category represents a distinct type of human capability that games can challenge.

## Using the Framework

### Analysing Games
When analysing a game's difficulty:
1. Focus on what players must do, not what the game presents.
2. Break down challenges into their fundamental components
3. Identify which core capabilities are being tested
4. Consider how different capabilities interact

If a game has _difficult souls-like bosses_ then we need to understand why and reframe that in a manner that reflects what the player is doing during these challenges. ex. understanding opponant attack patterns; deciding on a successful dodging strategy per attack; deciding on more agressive or defensive play; Reaction dodging to known attacks emotional management of frustration and enduring a longer challenge; strategising use of non-common items to overcome this boss compared to use those items later on harder bosses; strategising a more effective character build for the boss...

## Limitations and Scope

This framework specifically addresses:
- Difficulty analysis
- Player capability requirements
- Challenge decomposition

It addresses these elements so we may discuss and compare game difficulty in a maner that focuses on the player's actual or predicted experience.

It does not cover:
- Game genres
- Game mechanics
- Aesthetic qualities
- Content themes
- Design patterns
- Player motivation
- Player enjoyment

This is important to note because these all contribute to the experience of a player and often interact with the player's response to challenge in a game. For example, a player might have quit a game that is very challemging to them but the aesthetics or narrative of the game are so appealing that they persevere longer.

It is highly variable due to:
- The abilities of the assesor
- The playstyle biases of the assessor
- The variability of the player journey through a game

For example, a player with execellent performance and execution may never strategise a fight, rather they'll use ineffective techniques but perform/execute them at a 95th percentile level. They might rate a game extremely high in these elements and very low on strategy because they don't easily engage with games in this manner.

## Common Patterns

While the framework focuses on fundamental capabilities, common gameplay patterns emerge from combinations of these capabilities. For example:

Exploration in games is not a distinct category but a combination of:
- Performance (spatial navigation)
- Comprehension (understanding environment rules)
- Strategy (planning routes and approaches)
- Emotional Management (handling uncertainty)

These combinations create recognisable gameplay patterns while remaining analysable through the framework's fundamental categories.

## Best Practices

When using the framework:
- Always start with player responses, not game features
- Consider both immediate and long-term challenges
- Look for how fundamental capabilities combine
- Remember that similar game features might test different capabilities
- Consider context when analysing difficulty

## Framework Evolution

This framework is designed to be:
- Extensible within its categories
- Adaptable to new types of games
- Focused on fundamental human capabilities
- Clear about its scope and limitations

## Conclusion

By focusing on human responses rather than game features, this framework provides a robust tool for analysing game difficulty across any type of game. Understanding these fundamental categories and how they combine allows for deep analysis while maintaining clarity and usability. In turn, it will help us compare game mehcanics, games, and player expectations instead of just relying on highly abstracted notons of easy, medium, or hard difficulty.

# The Framework

## 1. Performance
Performance encompasses skills where immediate physical or neurological capability is the primary constraint on success. These are typically fast, unconscious, and direct actions with clear feedback loops and high certainty of outcomes.

### Simple Rubric
- If the challenge is about physical/neurological capability (reaction time, precision, timing), it's Performance
- If the challenge requires consistent physical execution of known inputs, it's Performance
- If success/failure is determined primarily by immediate physical execution, it's Performance
- If the challenge is about hitting specific timing windows, it's Performance

### Elements of Performance
- Reaction time and reflexes
- Hand-eye coordination
- Physical endurance and stamina
- Fine motor control and precision
- Rhythm perception and timing
- Visual tracking ability
- Input speed (Actions Per Minute)
- Muscle memory formation
- Consistent execution of precise inputs
- Managing physical fatigue
- Mental calculation speed and accuracy
- Concurrent input management
- Intuitive Manipulation of Vehicle controls and physics

### Examples
- Hitting complex combos in fighting games
- Precise aim tracking in FPS games
- Executing difficult platforming sequences
- Inputting high APM in strategy games
- On reaction blocking in fighting games

- Visual Processing: Reading attack animations in Monster Hunter to time dodges
- Reaction Inputs: Pure response time, such as blocking mix-ups in Street Fighter on reaction

## 2. Execution
Execution involves active mental processing and tactical decision-making in real-time situations. It represents the bridge between comprehesion and performance, focusing on adaptation and strategic application under pressure. Execution deals with mixed levels of certainty - outcomes are influenced by changing conditions but feedback loops remain relatively short.

### Simple Rubric
- If the challenge is about making real-time decisions based on available information, it's Execution
- If the challenge requires adapting to changing situations using known options, it's Execution
- If success/failure depends on choice quality rather than physical execution, it's Execution
- If the challenge involves managing resources in real-time, it's Execution

### Elements of Execution 
- Real-time decision making
- Tactical adaptation and flexibility
- Pattern recognition and response
- Priority management
- Threat assessment
- Resource allocation under time pressure
- Choosing which variations to calculate or analyse
- Managing limited time and attention
- 2D/3D Physics and spatial prediction

### Examples
- Adapting strategies mid-fight in combat games
- Changing tactics based on opponent patterns
- Managing cooldowns in MMO encounters
- Resource management and conservation in longer fights
- Adjusting playstyle based on matchup dynamics
- Making tactical decisions under time pressure
- Choosing chess variations in blitz games
- Processing situations and making positional decisions
- Deciding which chess lines to calculate
- Choosing targets in team fights
- Deciding whether it's better to change pokemon or tank a super effective attack.

#### Fighting Game - Tekken 8
- Recognising an opponant always ducks after a jab string
- Adapting to ducking behaviour by using mids post-jab
- Choosing between roll, tech roll, or staying down
- Adjusting offence against a heaviy parrying opponant.

### Suggested Rating Categories
- Tactical Adaptation: Changing behaviour after after identifying any significant information, such as changing your build order in StarCraft when scouting a rush. 
- Resource Management: Balancing one-time item usage or limited mana in a boss fight
- Pattern Recognition: Recognising opponent habits in fighting games or attack strings/behaviour changes in a Souls game.

- Threat Assessment: Evaluating which of 20+ mixed enemy types to focus on in a Souls-Like group encounter; or how the flow of enemies/objects will impact tactical success in an RTS.

## 3. Comprehension
Comprehension involves understanding game systems, patterns, and principles. It encompasses both basic mechanical understanding and complex strategic patterns that have become internalised knowledge. While comprehension can include sophisticated concepts, its core feature is that it's about understanding what is happening rather than making decisions about how to use that understanding. Generally, comprehension is about knowing and using provided and intuatable information then synthesising addiitonal understanding from this.

### Simple Rubric
- If the challenge is about understanding provided game systems and mechanics, it's Comprehension
- If the challenge involves synthesizing known information to understand interactions, it's Comprehension
- If success requires memorizing and understanding existing knowledge, it's Comprehension
- If the challenge can be solved through studying provided information, it's Comprehension

### Elements of Comprehension
- Understanding system mechanics and interactions
- Grasping strategic principles and patterns
- Recognising position types and their implications
- Knowledge of optimal approaches
- Understanding matchup dynamics
- Pattern recognition
- Integration of strategic concepts into intuitive understanding
- 2D/3D spatial memory

### Examples
- Understanding frame data in fighting games
- Grasping boss mechanics and optimal strategies in MMOs
- Knowledge of build orders in strategy games
- Understanding positional chess principles
- Recognising optimal item builds in MOBAs
- Understanding theoretical counters and responses
- Understanding move properties
- Recognising a weak pawn structure in chess
- Recognising when a position is advantageous

#### Fighting Game - Tekken 8
- Knowing the most common moves for each character.
- Understanding that moves marked as "Launch Punishable" in the move list can be punished with a launcher
- Recognizing that if a low move is -14 on block, you can punish it with a standing 14f move
- Understanding that back dashing creates space and can make moves whiff
- Synthesizing that if moves are minus on block, it's not "your turn" anymore

### Suggested Rating Categories
System Memorisation: Retaining fundemental or easily understandable knowledge of a game: such as rules, weapon options, chess openings, negative status effects, etc... Essentially how much is there to memorise when playing the game and how difficult is it to retain all of this?

Knowledge Management: When a game contains huge amounts of information beyond the ability of memorisation it may require the creation and maintenance of a knowledge management system. This could be as simple as making a notes for uncovering secrets in Tunic or require a genuine system like tracking all the card types and interactions for the toughest achievments in Cultist Simulator. 

System Understanding: How difficult is it to use the basic information of the game to get successful results? In chess, the basic information is simple but is difficult to understand, requiring a long educational journey for its players that really does stress their intelligence - such as the importance of pawn structures in competetive play. In Breath of the Wild there are a large number of items and systems but what they do is fairly intuitative and is not specifically stressed by the in game scenarios.

Complex System Interactions: How complex are the interactions between a game's systems, meaning how predictable are the outcomes of these interactions. We've covered various ways of obtaining and incorporating knowledge and understanding how those systems work. Again, in Chess you could understand Endgame patterns, pawn structures, different attacking styles, but synthesising all these elements of the game into a playstyle is hugely challenging as it is difficult to predict their implications especially with it being tested constantly by Chess' typical ranked competetive play, which is why chess has a large focus on the memorisation aspect of the game. Compared to Pokemon, where the implications of it's interacting systems are often quite straoghtforward even for a viewer to understand (with some notable surprises!)

## 4. Strategy
Strategy operates at a high level of abstraction, dealing with decisions about how to approach the game itself. It handles the longest feedback loops and highest levels of uncertainty. Strategy involves making decisions about which systems to engage with and how to allocate limited resources like time and attention. It usually involves making plans and commiting resources of some kind to them beyond the scope of an individual match or level. 

### Simple Rubric
- If the challenge involves long-term planning with known variables, it's Strategy
- If the challenge requires committing resources over extended periods, it's Strategy
- If success depends on balancing multiple known factors over time, it's Strategy
- If the challenge involves choosing between different long-term approaches, it's Strategy

### Elements of Strategy
- Long-term planning and resource allocation
- Balancing long and short term goals
- Decisions about what skills to develop
- Choosing which systems to engage with
- Understanding hidden costs and benefits
- Accounting for uncertainty in long-term decisions
- Balancing immediate versus long-term gains
- Meta-level understanding of game contexts

### Examples
- Deciding whether to master one character or learn many
- Choosing between an economic focus versus pure leveling in MMOs
- Selecting which game systems to invest time in learning
- Planning tournament preparation approaches
- Deciding between practicing fundamentals versus specific techniques in fighting games
- Choosing what openings to learn in chess based on playing style
- Balancing time between different aspects of improvement

#### Fighting Game - Tekken 8
- Choosing which characters to learn (ex. having a main plus pocket picks for bad matchups)
- Deciding whether to focus practice time on combo optimization, blocking fundementals, or movement

### Suggested Rating Categories
Learning Plan Development: Decing how to split personal development across fundementals, combo execution, character=specific matchup traianing, etc... in Tekken 8. 

Resource Construction Decisions: choosing which Pokémon, movesets, and EVs train for competetive team composition; or which relic weapon to build towards in Final Fantasy XI.
    Making a super long term decision with lot's of commitment needed.

- Long-Term Planning: ; or which fighting game character(s) to invest in.
- Resource Allocation: deciding which buildings to construct in Factorio supply chain
- System Engagement Choices: selecting which mechanics to master in Monster Hunter
- Risk/Reward Evaluation: deciding whether to push towers or farm in MOBAs
- Meta-level Adaption: choosing which characters to invest time in for tournament
- Time Investment Planning: balancing raid prep vs daily quests in MMOs
- Risk Management: diversifying practiced strategies before tournaments

## 5. Learning and Research
Learning and Research involves systematic approaches to understanding game systems when game-provided knowledge, natural intuition, and experience-based learning prove insufficient. It operates at a higher level of abstraction than Strategy, dealing with the creation and validation of new knowledge through systemic investigation.

### Simple Rubric
- If the challenge requires creating new knowledge through systematic investigation, it's Learning/Research
- If the challenge cannot be solved through provided information or intuition alone, it's Learning/Research
- If success requires developing new methodologies or testing procedures, it's Learning/Research
- If the challenge involves validating community theories or assumptions, it's Learning/Research

### Elements of LEarning and Research
- Systematic approaches to understanding complex systems
- Hypothesis generation and testing
- Data collection and analysis methodologies
- Knowledge validation and verification
- Tool development and implementation
- Meta-cognitive skills (questioning existing knowledge)
- Research planning and resource management
- Documentation and knowledge sharing

### Examples
- Developing parsing tools to measure true DPS contributions
- Systematic testing of obscure mechanics (like FF11 gardening)
- Creating frameworks to validate community theories
- Building and testing hypotheses about complex systems
- Developing methodologies for testing game mechanics
- Conducting long-term studies of variable systems
- Creating documentation and proving findings to others

Learning/Research activates when:
- Strategy identifies critical knowledge gaps
- Natural pattern recognition hits its limits
- Experience-based heuristics prove unreliable
- Systems are too complex for intuitive understanding
- Feedback loops are too long for natural learning

The knowledge gained through Learning/Research can eventually be simplified into heuristics and patterns that work within the Comprehension-Execution axis, but the original research process requires dedicated systematic approach beyond normal play.

#### Fighting Game - Tekken 8
- Developing and testing new movement techniques (like how Korean Backdash was discovered)
- Lab testing to document exact plus frames after specific moves hit at different heights

- Documentation Methods [maintaining wikis for complex game systems]
- Research Planning [organizing testing for optimal MMO raid strategies]

## 6. Meta-Adaptation and External Knowledge
 Involves predicting and leveraging changes in game environments before they fully manifest. Unlike strategy which operates within known systems, meta-adaptation deals with gathering external knowledge, anticipating how systems themselves will evolve through developer intervention, community discovery, and collective player behavior. It operates with a high level of uncertainty and long feedback loops. Knowledge also includes all useful topics to know  that are not included in a game but will aid effective play - such as knowing languages in a social game or American Pop Culture in US-developed trivia games.

### Simple Rubric
- If the challenge requires knowledge from outside the game itself, it's Meta/External
- If success depends on predicting future changes to game systems, it's Meta/External
- If the challenge involves understanding developer patterns or community trends, it's Meta/External
- If the challenge requires non-game knowledge to succeed, it's Meta/External

### Key Elements

## 7. Emotional Management
Emotional Management encompasses the skills and capabilities related to understanding, controlling, and effectively channeling emotions during gameplay. It involves both immediate emotional regulation and longer-term emotional resilience, affecting how players handle challenges, process outcomes, and maintain effective engagement with games. This includes managing both personal emotional responses and emotions triggered by social interactions.

### Simple Rubric
- If the challenge is about managing personal emotional responses, it's Emotional Management
- If success requires maintaining composure under pressure, it's Emotional Management

## Translating Game Challenges into Player Challenges
Most challenges a game provides to a user will cover multiple catagories. Your job as an assessor is to incorporate this into your ratings. For example:

Using an Electric Wind God Fist in tournement play Tekken 8:

Highly Relevant:
Performance: Physical execution of the EWGF input under pressure
Execution: Choosing the right moment to attempt it
Emotional: Managing tournament pressure and nerves
Comprehension: Understanding when and why EWGF is the right choice

Less Relevant:
Social: Handling the crowd and tournament environment
Strategy: While your long-term practice choices matter, they're not actively tested in this moment
Meta/External: Unless you're specifically countering a known player tendency, this isn't a key factor
Learning/Research: Not relevant unless you're doing something completely new with EWGF

# Rating Game Difficulty
We've spent some time reviewing what kind of player challenges go where in the framework. Now we have to provide some guidance on rating. For the Difficulty Wheel Visualiser tool provided alongside this framework, I offered a 1-100 rating of each of the suggested subcategories, which then feed into a total score at the parent category level and is rperesented relatively with the size of the parent category wedge's colouration.

But what constitues a 1 or 100 rating? Broadly:
A 1 rating means this skill is not tested at all by the game. 
A 50 rating means this skill is tested but is likely to be approachable for most players or is comparable to the difficulty from the majority of games.
A 100 rating means this skill is tested at the peak of human performance. I would encourage you to consider how a game's mechanics and player tests compare against an example from top-level E-sports.

So with our Tekken 8 example, at the level of elite competetive play, it could recieve ratings such as:
Input Complexity: 80/100, character dependant, you can have multiple instaces of frame perfect execution with Korean backdashes and EWGFs. 
Reaction Inputs: 85/100, plenty of game changing moments are decided by reaction inputs, such as throw breaking and punishers.
Meta Knowledge: 25/100, because the game mechanics are fairly stable and knowledge is useful over the long term (often over mutiple games).

We could see some very low ratings in the following examples:
A pure visual novel with no minigames would recieve < 5/100 for input complexity. Since it is just pressing one button based on how much text you have read. A 1 out of 100 could be a game with no traditional inputs, such as Before Your Eyes.

# Framework Considerations
## Combinatorial Analysis
### Examples
Social Difficulty frequently combines with other categories to create complex challenges:
- With Performance: Coordinating group execution, managing team rotations
- With Execution: Communicating tactical decisions, coordinating real-time responses
- With Comprehension: Sharing and validating knowledge, teaching others
- With Strategy: Organizing long-term group efforts, managing social resources
- With Learning/Research: Building knowledge-sharing networks, coordinating group research
- With Meta-adaptation: Managing group responses to changes, coordinating strategic shifts
- With Emotional Management: Handling group morale, managing team psychology

The effectiveness of social skills often amplifies or enables other types of difficulty management, while core social challenges remain distinct and fundamental to multiplayer gaming environments.

## Spectrum Analysis
These categories exist along several key spectrums:

### Speed Spectrum (Slow → Fast)
- Comprehension: Slowest - requires time for analysis
- Execution: Medium - real-time decisions with tactical thinking
- Performance: Fastest - immediate reactions

### Consciousness Spectrum (Conscious → Unconscious)
- Comprehension: Most conscious - active analysis
- Execution: Mixed - blend of conscious and intuitive
- Performance: Most unconscious - trained reactions

### Directness Spectrum (Indirect → Direct)
- Comprehension: Most indirect - theoretical understanding
- Execution: Mixed - applying knowledge tactically
- Performance: Most direct - immediate action/reaction

### Certainty Spectrum (Certain > Uncertain)

#### Performance (Most Certain)
"If I press these buttons in this sequence, this combo will come out"
- Clear, immediate feedback
- Success/failure is instantly apparent
- Physical constraints are well understood

#### Execution (Mixed Certainty)
"If I see the boss wind up this attack, blocking is probably better than dodging"
- Short feedback loops
- Outcomes influenced by changing conditions
- Some variables but still relatively contained

#### Comprehension (Less Certain)
"I understand how this system works in principle"
- Longer feedback loops
- More variables to consider
- Theory might not match practice

#### Strategy (Very Uncertain)
"Investing 20 hours in learning the economy might pay off better than 20 hours of combat practice"
- Very long feedback loops
- Huge number of variables
- Success metrics might not be clear
- What worked for others might not work for you
- Meta changes could invalidate investments
