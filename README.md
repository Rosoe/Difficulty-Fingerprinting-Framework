# Game Difficulty Framework

## Introduction

### Understanding Human Responses to Gaming Challenges

This framework provides a structured approach to analysing game difficulty by focusing on the fundamental human capabilities and responses that games test, rather than specific mechanics or genres. By focusing on player responses rather than game features, we can create a robust model that adapts to any type of game challenge.

### Core Principles

#### Player-Centric Analysis

Instead of categorising what games present to players, this framework examines how players are challenged. This approach allows us to:

- Analyse any game, regardless of genre or style
- Identify common patterns across seemingly different games
- Understand how various challenges stress different player capabilities

#### Fundamental Categories

The framework is built around eight core categories of player response:

- Performance (neurological/physical capabilities)
- Execution (decision making)
- Comprehension (understanding systems)
- Strategy (long-term planning)
- Learning/Research (systematic investigation)
- Meta and External Knowledge (Non-game knowledge and prediction)
- Emotional Management (handling pressure/setbacks)
- Social (managing social dynamics)

Each category represents a distinct type of human capability that games can challenge.

### Using the Framework

#### Analysing Games

When analysing a game's difficulty:

1. Focus on what players must do, not what the game presents.
2. Break down challenges into their fundamental components
3. Identify which core capabilities are being tested
4. Consider how different capabilities interact

If a game has _difficult souls-like bosses_ then we need to understand why and reframe that in a manner that reflects what the player is doing during these challenges. ex. understanding opponent attack patterns; deciding on a successful dodging strategy per attack; deciding on more aggressive or defensive play; Reaction dodging to known attacks emotional management of frustration and enduring a longer challenge; strategising use of non-common items to overcome this boss compared to use those items later on harder bosses; strategising a more effective character build for the boss...

### Limitations and Scope

This framework specifically addresses:

- Difficulty analysis
- Player capability requirements
- Challenge decomposition

It addresses these elements so we may discuss and compare game difficulty in a manner that focuses on the player's actual or predicted experience.

It does not cover:

- Game genres
- Game mechanics
- Aesthetic qualities
- Content themes
- Design patterns
- Player motivation
- Player enjoyment

This is important to note because these all contribute to the experience of a player and often interact with the player's response to challenge in a game. For example, a player might have quit a game that is very challenging to them but the aesthetics or narrative of the game are so appealing that they persevere longer.

It is highly variable due to:

- The abilities of the assessor
- The playstyle biases of the assessor
- The variability of the player journey through a game

For example, a player with excellent performance and execution may never strategise a fight, rather they'll use ineffective techniques but perform/execute them at a 95th percentile level. They might rate a game extremely high in these elements and very low on strategy because they don't easily engage with games in this manner.

### Common Patterns

While the framework focuses on fundamental capabilities, common gameplay patterns emerge from combinations of these capabilities. For example:

Exploration in games is not a distinct category but a combination of:

- Performance (spatial navigation)
- Comprehension (understanding environment rules)
- Strategy (planning routes and approaches)
- Emotional Management (handling uncertainty)

These combinations create recognisable gameplay patterns while remaining analysable through the framework's fundamental categories.

### Best Practices

When using the framework:

- Always start with player responses, not game features
- Consider both immediate and long-term challenges
- Look for how fundamental capabilities combine
- Remember that similar game features might test different capabilities
- Consider context when analysing difficulty

### Framework Evolution

This framework is designed to be:

- Extensible within its categories
- Adaptable to new types of games
- Focused on fundamental human capabilities
- Clear about its scope and limitations

### Applications of the Game Difficulty Framework

### How to Rate Game Difficulty

We've spent some time reviewing what kind of player challenges go where in the framework. Now we have to provide some guidance on rating. For the Difficulty Wheel Visualiser tool provided alongside this framework, I offered a 1-100 rating of each of the suggested subcategories, which then feed into a total score at the parent category level and is represented relatively with the size of the parent category wedge's colouration.

But what constitutes a 1 or 100 rating? Broadly:
A 1 rating means this skill is not tested at all by the game.
A 50 rating means this skill is tested but is likely to be approachable for most players or is comparable to the difficulty from the majority of games.
A 100 rating means this skill is tested at the peak of human performance. I would encourage you to consider how a game's mechanics and player tests compare against an example from top-level E-sports.

So with our Tekken 8 example, at the level of elite competitive play, it could receive ratings such as:
Input Complexity: 80/100, character dependant, you can have multiple instances of frame perfect execution with Korean backdashes and EWGFs.
Reaction Inputs: 85/100, plenty of game changing moments are decided by reaction inputs, such as throw breaking and punishers.
Meta Knowledge: 25/100, because the game mechanics are fairly stable and knowledge is useful over the long term (often over multiple games).

We could see some very low ratings in the following examples:
A pure visual novel with no mini games would receive < 5/100 for input complexity. Since it is just pressing one button based on how much text you have read. A 1 out of 100 could be a game with no traditional inputs, such as Before Your Eyes.

### Conclusion

By focusing on human responses rather than game features, this framework provides a robust tool for analysing game difficulty across any type of game. Understanding these fundamental categories and how they combine allows for deep analysis while maintaining clarity and usability. In turn, it will help us compare game mechanics, games, and player expectations instead of just relying on highly abstracted notions of easy, medium, or hard difficulty.

## The Framework

### 1. Performance

Performance encompasses skills where immediate physical or neurological capability is the primary constraint on success. These are typically fast, unconscious, and direct actions with clear feedback loops and high certainty of outcomes.

#### Performance's Simple Rubric

- If the challenge is about physical/neurological capability (reaction time, precision, timing), it's Performance
- If the challenge requires consistent physical execution of known inputs, it's Performance
- If success/failure is determined primarily by immediate physical execution, it's Performance
- If the challenge is about hitting specific timing windows, it's Performance

#### Elements of Performance

- Reaction time and reflexes
- Hand-eye coordination
- Physical endurance and stamina
- Fine motor control and precision
- Rhythm perception and timing
- Visual tracking ability
- Input speed (Actions Per Minute)
- Muscle memory formation
- Consistent execution of precise inputs
- Managing physical fatigue
- Mental calculation speed and accuracy
- Concurrent input management
- Intuitive Manipulation of Vehicle controls and physics

#### Performance: Suggested Rating Categories

- Input Precision
    Pressing the right buttons, in the right order, at the right time, consistently.
        ex. Executing a perfect wavedash in Super Smash Bros Melee, fighting game combos, or stomping in directions on an arcade DDR machine.
- Motor Control
    Tracking target objects and manipulating them successfully. Typical where the controls are not complex but where control is.
        ex. Maintaining aim on and shooting a moving target in CS:GO; threading Mario through multiple platforming objects; or driving a car in Gran Turismo.
- Mathematical Processing
    Quickly determining the best course of action by calculating numerical advantages and disadvantages in real-time, such as damage values, resource costs, or risk/reward ratios.
        ex. Calculating the damage advantages of one card versus another in The Bazaar; determining optimal resource allocation in real-time strategy games.
- Visual and Spatial Processing
    Tracking objects on the screen and determining basic collision paths and movement patterns.
        ex. Avoiding hundreds of individual objects in Enter the Gungeon; Reading attack animations in Elden Ring to time dodges.
- Reaction Inputs
    Response time to perceived actions and triggers.
        ex. Pure response time, such as blocking mix-ups in Street Fighter on reaction.
- Physical Fatigue
    Overcoming the physiological stress that a video game places on a player.
        ex. Resisting the urge to blink in Before Your Eyes; maintaining high actions per minute on an arcade Dance Dance Revolution cabinet; Staying awake through sleep fatigue for the Absolute Virtue fight in Final Fantasy XI.

### 2. Execution

Execution involves active mental processing and tactical decision-making in real-time situations. It represents the bridge between comprehension and performance, focusing on adaptation and strategic application under pressure. Execution deals with mixed levels of certainty - outcomes are influenced by changing conditions but feedback loops remain relatively short.

### Executions' Simple Rubric

- If the challenge is about making real-time decisions based on available information, it's Execution
- If the challenge requires adapting to changing situations using known options, it's Execution
- If success/failure depends on choice quality rather than physical execution, it's Execution
- If the challenge involves managing resources in real-time, it's Execution

### Elements of Execution

- Real-time decision making
- Tactical adaptation and flexibility
- Pattern recognition and response
- Priority management
- Threat assessment
- Resource allocation under time pressure
- Choosing which variations to calculate or analyse
- Managing limited time and attention
- 2D/3D Physics and spatial prediction

### Execution: Suggested Rating Categories

- Tactical Adaptation:
    Changing behaviour after after identifying new information
        ex. Changing build order in StarCraft after scouting an enemy rush build.
- Resource Management:
    Keeping track of available options, often limited or one time use, and meting out their use to best effect
        ex. Effectively utilising limited items during long boss fight sessions in Elden Ring.
- Pattern Recognition:
    Identifying repetitive behaviour that can be exploited in the short term.
        ex. Recognising opponent habits in fighting games; identifying attack strings/behaviour changes in a Souls game.
- Attention Management:
    Attending to multiple high priority, time limited, important responsibilities in the moment.
        ex. Multi-tasking attention across healing, shielding, buffs, enfeebles, damage, and communication as a healing class in FFXIV.
- Threat Assessment:
    Assessing the highest priority issues facing you in a real-time situation.
        ex. Evaluating which of 5+ enemy types to focus on in a group encounter in Dark Souls; how the flow of enemies/objects will impact the tactical success of an attack in an RTS; or which line to defend when being overtaken on both sides in Forza Horizon 5.

## 3. Comprehension

Comprehension involves understanding game systems, patterns, and principles. It encompasses both basic mechanical understanding and complex strategic patterns that have become internalised knowledge. While comprehension can include sophisticated concepts, its core feature is that it's about understanding what is happening rather than making decisions about how to use that understanding. Generally, comprehension is about knowing and using provided and intuitable information then synthesising additional understanding from this.

### Comprehension's Simple Rubric

- If the challenge is about understanding provided game systems and mechanics, it's Comprehension
- If the challenge involves synthesising known information to understand interactions, it's Comprehension
- If success requires memorising and understanding existing knowledge, it's Comprehension
- If the challenge can be solved through studying provided information, it's Comprehension

### Comprehension: Suggested Rating Categories

System Memorisation
    Retaining fundamental or easily understandable knowledge of a game: such as rules, weapon options, chess openings, moves, negative status effects.
        ex. Memorisation of all 1,025 pokemon and critical info, all 934 moves/attacks, all 171 pokemon type interactions...
Knowledge Management
   Creation and maintenance of a knowledge management system when memory isn't enough.
        ex. Writing out puzzle notes for Tunic's endgame or keeping a PKM for card interactions in Book of Hours.
Systems Understanding
    How difficult is it to use the basic information of the game to get successful results? In chess, the basic information is simple but is difficult to understand, requiring a long educational journey for its players that really does stress their intelligence. Whereas In Breath of the Wild has a large number of items and systems but their functions are intuitive.
        ex. Understanding the different symbol meanings in The Witness' puzzles.
Complex System Interactions
    How complex are the interactions between a game's systems and how predictable are the outcomes of these interactions.
        ex. Understanding whether a Pokemon attack will be a single hit KO when it is a STAB water attack against Grass/Fire dual-type with the Rain weather effect in play.

## 4. Strategy

Strategy operates at a high level of abstraction, dealing with decisions about how to approach the game itself. It can involve planning, genuine strategy creation, the high-level application of game knowledge for long-term benefit, and the synthesis of different game knowledge networks for unique ideas - as opposed to comprehension where we consider more immediate implications of game knowledge and systems interactions. It covers the creation of goals, structures, control and feedback systems to improve a player's results within a game. It handles long feedback loops and higher levels of uncertainty.

### Strategy's Simple Rubric

- If the challenge involves high-level knowledge synthesis across multiple areas of a game, it's Strategy
- If the challenge requires committing resources over extended periods, it's Strategy
- If success depends on balancing multiple known factors over time, it's Strategy
- If the challenge involves choosing between different long-term approaches, it's Strategy

### Elements of Strategy

- Long-term planning and resource allocation
- Balancing long and short term goals
- Decisions about what skills to develop
- Choosing which systems to engage with
- Understanding hidden costs and benefits
- Accounting for uncertainty in long-term decisions
- Balancing immediate versus long-term gains
- Meta-level understanding of game contexts

### Strategy: Suggested Rating Categories

- Risk and Opportunity Assessment
    Identifying opportunities and problems that need significant investment to overcome or leverage.  
        ex. Identifying a meta trend for stalling teams in Pokemon, which are a weakness a low damage team.
- Strategic Decision Making
    Balancing all decision making factors to come to the best conclusion.
        ex. Deciding which Pokemon team and setups to use in a tournament.
- Planning and Goal Setting
    Planning work and keeping track of goals so you can complete them consistently.
        ex. Prioritising the development of specific pokemon that critical to your new team composition.
- Time Management
    Keeping to an effective schedule to achieve the results you had planned.
        ex. Scheduling in 2-hours of uninterruptible time to develop new pokemon before a tournament deadline.

## 5. Learning and Research

Learning and Research involves systematic approaches to understanding game systems when game-provided knowledge, natural intuition, and experience-based learning prove insufficient - or even when a game choses not to present data that a player deems critical. Knowledge gained through Learning and Research can eventually be simplified into heuristics and patterns that work within the Comprehension-Execution axis, but the original research process requires dedicated systematic approach beyond normal play. It operates at a higher level of abstraction than Strategy, dealing with the creation and validation of new knowledge through systemic investigation.

### Learning and Research's Simple Rubric

- If the challenge requires creating new knowledge through systematic investigation, it's Learning/Research
- If the challenge cannot be solved through provided information or intuition alone, it's Learning/Research
- If success requires developing new methodologies or testing procedures, it's Learning/Research
- If the challenge involves validating community theories or assumptions, it's Learning/Research

### Elements of Learning and Research

- Systematic approaches to understanding complex systems
- Hypothesis generation and testing
- Data collection and analysis methodologies
- Knowledge validation and verification
- Tool development and implementation
- Meta-cognitive skills (questioning existing knowledge)
- Research planning and resource management
- Documentation and knowledge sharing

### Learning and Research: Suggested Rating Categories

- Novel Theory/Hypothesis Development
    Using current knowledge to identify gaps and opportunities where gain new knowledge is essential or interesting.
        ex. Brainstorming new redstone mechanisms in Minecraft; theorising potential solution ideas for puzzles in Tunic; hypothesising about growth mechanics in Final Fantasy XI's gardening system.
- Systematic Testing, Recording, and Data Validation
    Identifying what data is needed to prove a particular fact or idea and creating methods to obtain that data and record it.
     ex. Recording exact frame data for moves in Guilty Gear -Strive-.
- Research Tool Development
    Producing tools that overcome data collection barriers in game, such as parsers
        ex. Creating DPS parsing tools to aid FFXIV damage rotation optimisation projects.
- Data Analysis
    Reviewing findings for key insights and other paths of research to meet key in-game goals.
        ex. Analyzing DPS logs in FFXIV to identify optimal rotation timings; reviewing match replay data in League of Legends to identify winning patterns.
- Documentation Methods
    Producing documentation and content so other players can benefit from learned knowledge. Could be for just your friends, your guild, or the community as a whole.
        ex. Creating and maintaining wiki pages for complex crafting systems in MMOs; documenting frame data and combo routes for fighting games; writing detailed guides for raid encounters.

## 6. Meta-Knowledge and External Knowledge/Resources

Knowledge and resources external to the game that can influence performance within a game. This includes understanding the meta strategies of a game that are not presented formally within the game; external human knowledge that proves useful when playing a game; or external resources that can be leveraged for an advantage within the game, such as money. Often most relevant in live service and competitive games.

### Meta-Knowledge and External Knowledge/Resources's Simple Rubric

- If the challenge benefits from knowledge gained outside the game itself, it's Meta/External
- If success depends on predicting future changes to game systems, it's Meta/External
- If the challenge involves understanding developer patterns or community trends, it's Meta/External
- If the challenge requires non-game knowledge to succeed, it's Meta/External

### Meta-Knowledge and External Knowledge/Resources Key Elements

- Anticipating shifts in competitive environment
- Knowledge of specialist subject used or useful within the game
- Predicting developer balance decisions and their cascading effects
- Understanding community psychology and behaviour patterns
- Identifying emerging trends before they become dominant
- Learning about historical patterns to predict future developments
- Reading multiple layers of human behaviour (developers, pros, community)

### Meta-Knowledge, External Knowledge, and External Resources: Suggested Rating Categories

- External Real-World Knowledge
    Covers every piece of real world knowledge that might be helpful in a game. Definition is necessarily broad for the purpose of this system.
        ex. Knowing a lot about American Pop Culture when playing Jackbox quiz games; speaking Japanese in a multi-region MMORPG server; knowing how to code custom mods for your World-First WoW guild's personal use.
- External Resources
    If money can act as a substitute for progression in a game then having that available to a player is a legitimate source of difficulty that can be overcome variably by different players. The whole concept of pay to win games is predicated on this notion.
        ex. Buying gold in an MMORPG so you can transfer time spent on economy to MSQ progression; buying inventory space items in Path of Exile.
- Game Meta Knowledge
    Having access and interest in the meta strategies, developments, and predictions that are not a part of the game but can or will affect play in game.
        ex. Predicting PvP relevant changes in World of Warcraft (so one can prepare characters in advance for a Day 1 advantage.); predicting developer intentions around item nerfs (so you can buy/sell bull/bear markets for profit.); racking the win rates of different characters in Super Smash Bros (to aid selection of competitive main characters to learn.)

## 7. Emotional Management

Emotional Management encompasses the skills and capabilities related to understanding, controlling, and effectively channelling emotions during gameplay. It involves both immediate emotional regulation and longer-term emotional resilience, affecting how players handle challenges, process outcomes, and maintain effective engagement with games. This includes managing both personal emotional responses and emotions triggered by social interactions.

### Emotional Management Simple Rubric

- If the challenge is about managing personal emotional responses, it's Emotional Management
- If success requires maintaining composure under pressure, it's Emotional Management
- If the challenge involves processing setbacks constructively, it's Emotional Management
- If the challenge is about managing confidence or anxiety, it's Emotional Management

### Emotional Management Key Elements

- Managing immediate emotional responses (frustration, anxiety, excitement)
- Maintaining emotional stability and composure
- Building and managing confidence and self-esteem
- Developing emotional resilience and stamina
- Recognising and adapting to emotional states
- Channelling positive emotions productively
- Processing failure and setbacks constructively
- Sustaining motivation and patience
- Managing social-emotional responses (shame, pride, acceptance)
- Handling peer pressure and social anxiety
- Processing social validation and criticism

### Emotional Management Suggested Rating Categories

- Composure and Performance Under Pressure
    Maintain high performance levels despite the tension of completing a difficult task for high stakes.
        ex. Keeping to your strategy when a boss is on one hit, rather than making a risky hit in Elden Ring; closing out a 1 v 3 win in competitive CounterStrike 2.
- Emotional Patience and Resilience
    Being able to wait a long time or endure many difficulties before experiencing tangible benefits.
        ex. Persevering with obtuse puzzles with little to no feedback in Tunic's end game; saving relic weapon currency for 12-24 months in Golden Age Final Fantasy XI; long periods with zero progression in skills or results in competitive shooters.
- Tilt, Rage, and Frustration Control
    Neutralising or utilising angry and frustrated emotions to maintain performance after losses and failures.
        ex. Dropping a combo and leaving your opponent on 1hp in Tekken 8; Getting 3-stocked in competitive Super Smash Bros and winning the next set.

## 8. Social Management

Social Difficulty encompasses skills related to navigating multiplayer social structures, managing relationships, and coordinating group efforts. It involves understanding social hierarchies, building and maintaining connections, and effectively collaborating with others to achieve shared goals. While social elements can interact with and potentially bypass other types of difficulty, core social difficulty focuses on fundamental interpersonal and organizational capabilities.

### Social Management's Simple Rubric

- If the challenge involves navigating relationships with other players, it's Social
- If success requires coordinating with or managing groups, it's Social
- If the challenge is about building or maintaining community connections, it's Social
- If the challenge involves effective communication in gaming contexts, it's Social

### Elements of Social Management

- Understanding and navigating social hierarchies
- Building and maintaining trust
- Project management and coordination
- Leadership and followership capabilities
- Reading and adapting to social norms
- Managing group dynamics and conflicts
- Cross-cultural communication
- Effective team communication
- Maintaining reputation and relationships
- Organisational skills and delegation

### Social Management: Suggested Rating Categories

- Leadership
    Taking charge of social groups and progressing with purpose.
        Leading an experience point party in Final Fantasy XI; running a raiding guild in World of Warcraft; Organising a scratch PvP group in Valorant.
- Coordination and Teamwork
    Adjusting your actions in relation to others.
        ex. Adjusting your hero shooter play style to accommodate and compliment team mates in Overwatch; Levelling a support job in an MMO because they are more in demand for experience and end game; defending a lane conservatively when you trust your team is going to support you shortly; helping a friend with MSQ progression in an MMO.
- Mentoring and Teaching
    Teaching and helping others learn how to do something or become a a better version of themselves.
        ex. Teaching a player how to manage distances in League of Legends to avoid being farmed for XP; showing a guild member how to complete raid pre-requisites so they are prepared and easier to work with later.
- Negotiation and Conflict
    Having discussions aimed at finding agreements and ways to progress forward when there are issues.
        ex. Reaching a compromise with your party over who should cast lots for a desirable item, such as agreeing to give you a more valuable item later; agreeing to sell crafting materials under market value in exchange for help developing your own crafting skills in an MMO; agreeing to help a player build their minecraft building in exchange for help with yours.
- Persuasion and Deal Making
    Having discussions where the aim is to persuade someone to accept or work with your beliefs or to close deals on terms beneficial to you.
        ex. Making beneficial trade deals with asymmetric information in Civilisation V; convincing a team member to switch characters for a more balanced team composition in Deadlock; convincing a guild leader to ignore DKP because there are significant strategic reasons you should obtain a valuable item.
- Politics and Hierarchies
    Understanding and navigating formal and informal power structures within gaming communities.
        ex. Managing relationships between different raid teams in an MMO guild; navigating tournament organizer relationships in competitive gaming; understanding and working within the hierarchy of a large gaming clan.

## Translating Game Challenges into Player Challenges

Most challenges a game provides to a user will cover multiple categories. Your job as an assessor is to incorporate this into your ratings. For example:

Using an Electric Wind God Fist in tournament play Tekken 8:

Highly Relevant:
Performance: Physical execution of the EWGF input under pressure
Execution: Choosing the right moment to attempt it
Emotional: Managing tournament pressure and nerves
Comprehension: Understanding when and why EWGF is the right choice

Less Relevant:
Social: Handling the crowd and tournament environment
Strategy: While your long-term practice choices matter, they're not actively tested in this moment
Meta/External: Unless you're specifically countering a known player tendency, this isn't a key factor
Learning/Research: Not relevant unless you're doing something completely new with EWGF

## Framework Considerations

### Combinatorial Analysis

#### Social Difficulty Example

Social Difficulty frequently combines with other categories to create complex challenges:

- With Performance: Coordinating group execution, managing team rotations
- With Execution: Communicating tactical decisions, coordinating real-time responses
- With Comprehension: Sharing and validating knowledge, teaching others
- With Strategy: Organising long-term group efforts, managing social resources
- With Learning/Research: Building knowledge-sharing networks, coordinating group research
- With Meta-adaptation: Managing group responses to changes, coordinating strategic shifts
- With Emotional Management: Handling group morale, managing team psychology

The effectiveness of social skills often amplifies or enables other types of difficulty management, while core social challenges remain distinct and fundamental to multiplayer gaming environments.

## Spectrum Analysis

These categories exist along several key spectrums:

### Speed Spectrum (Slow → Fast)

- Comprehension: Slowest - requires time for analysis
- Execution: Medium - real-time decisions with tactical thinking
- Performance: Fastest - immediate reactions

### Consciousness Spectrum (Conscious → Unconscious)

- Comprehension: Most conscious - active analysis
- Execution: Mixed - blend of conscious and intuitive
- Performance: Most unconscious - trained reactions

### Directness Spectrum (Indirect → Direct)

- Comprehension: Most indirect - theoretical understanding
- Execution: Mixed - applying knowledge tactically
- Performance: Most direct - immediate action/reaction

### Certainty Spectrum (Certain > Uncertain)

#### Performance (Most Certain)

"If I press these buttons in this sequence, this combo will come out"

- Clear, immediate feedback
- Success/failure is instantly apparent
- Physical constraints are well understood

#### Execution (Mixed Certainty)

"If I see the boss wind up this attack, blocking is probably better than dodging"

- Short feedback loops
- Outcomes influenced by changing conditions
- Some variables but still relatively contained

#### Comprehension (Less Certain)

"I understand how this system works in principle"

- Longer feedback loops
- More variables to consider
- Theory might not match practice

#### Strategy (Very Uncertain)

"Investing 20 hours in learning the economy might pay off better than 20 hours of combat practice"

- Very long feedback loops
- Huge number of variables
- Success metrics might not be clear
- What worked for others might not work for you
- Meta changes could invalidate investments
